# Rove
Meet Rove, your passport to endless travel inspiration â€“ discover, bookmark, and explore your dream destinations effortlessly.

# IMPORTANT NOTE!
We have removed the API Key from the database seed file, it was initially setup for the demo purpose. Currently all the API keys existed in the seed file will no longer be valid anymore. This will result all the images for each location will be blank, however, we got good news. You are required to get your own API key from Google Maps and all the new schedules that you will be adding; will contain images.

Also, the more the user add different part of the world destinations, the more place will show up for suggestions.

# Notes
A Lighthouse Labs's Student Final Project.

App is entirely base on user data. We setup the initial database seed to kick start with data (Who's first chicken or egg?).

## Stretched 
- Mobile Optimization.
- Rework backend for Mobile compliance.
- Rework Style Strutures.
- Rework Google API integration to avoid CORS issues.
